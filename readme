hat was wrong: The Next.js build cache (.next folder) was corrupted, causing static assets (CSS, JS) to return 404 errors.

What I did:

Cleared the .next build cache
Restarted the dev server
Your dev server is now running cleanly on: 👉 http://localhost:3002

Next steps:

Open http://localhost:3002 in your browser
The page should load without any 404 errors
Test the waitlist form - it should work perfectly now
If you want to deploy to Vercel, check the vercel_deployment.md guide I created. With GitHub integration, every push will auto-deploy! 🚀
